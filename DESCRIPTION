Description: Like the 'miniCRAN' and 'drat' packages, 'cranlift' allows
  users to manage their own 'CRAN'-like R package archives. However,
  'cranlift' does so by running a fully-featured API server that exposes
  packages as resources that can be added, deleted, and modified using
  HTTP requests, in line with 'RESTful' design principles.
